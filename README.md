# Toki Sans
Top Kirara Sans is yet another CJK gothic font based on Source Han Sans CN Medium. 

Gothic-style exclamation and question marks are replaced with manga-style marks. 
Italic exclamation marks are available under stylistic alternates (Softwares need OTF feature support to display them correctly). 
CJK vertical Em Dashs are adjusted to be wider, and linked to U+2014 "—" in "vert" table. 
A feature of ellipsis U+2026 "…" is removed to solve some issue with Photoshop.
